Alzheimer’s Research UK

Our application aims to raise awareness for Alzheimer’s disease by primarily targeting younger population to achieve greater exposure. We developed a Web app that incorporates today’s most ubiquitous social media. The app engages the audience with a series of facts (most importantly common misconceptions) about Alzheimer’s disease. The focus remains on the social media aspect of the app– a user can share the app on Facebook, but more importantly, if the user states all questions correctly, they receive a unique Snapchat filter to the foundation (with a Alzheimer’s Research UK tag), which should facilitate immense publicity for the charity. The game is carried out by selecting random pre-defined questions, which we would (have we had more time) implemented as a database (currently simply as arrays). If a person has won, they will be able to claim the earned filter directly from the application, donate, and share the application on Facebook (as suggested by the organisation).

We believe this approach is ingenious, because Snapchat filters is one of the, if not the most universal way to share information fast in an entertaining or captivating way– the Snapchat organisation even posts worldwide snapchat stories that raise awareness for particular causes. Snapchat is known to carry out these type of events for the greater good. In a likely mutual relationship, a filter could be developed and provided to those who engaged in the application (but only those, making it necessary for users to engage in the game first and indeed learn about the disease, which we believe is as important, if not more important than providing publicity – people need to become aware of the real symptoms of Alzheimer’s, as the public is currently not as exposed to facts of Alzheimer’s as, for example, cancer or heart diseases.) We believe the Web application we developed could be a truly remarkable choice for the organisation, as only a few (if any at all) charities have done this before, and not in such a developed approach as this one.


We made use of HTML & CSS by leveraging the Bootstrap UI framework, and JavaScript with JQuery for making an interactive web app. We decided that having a web server and keeping a database are not necessary for the proof of concept of the app.
